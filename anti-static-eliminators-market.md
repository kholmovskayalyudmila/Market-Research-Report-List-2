<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Eliminators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type Static Eliminators</li><li>Induction Type Static Eliminators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Contact type static eliminators and induction type static eliminators are two types of anti-static eliminators used in various industries. Contact type static eliminators work by physically contacting the static charge to neutralize it, using methods such as brushes, bars, or nozzles. Induction type static eliminators, on the other hand, work by creating an oscillating electric field to neutralize the static charge without direct contact. Both types are effective in removing static charges from materials and surfaces, but the choice depends on the specific application and requirements.</p></p>
