<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rain Water Harvesting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Above Ground</li><li>Underground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater for future use. There are two main types of rainwater harvesting systems: above ground and underground. Above ground systems typically include rain barrels and cisterns placed on the surface to collect rainwater, which can then be used for various purposes such as irrigation or flushing toilets. Underground systems, on the other hand, consist of storage tanks buried beneath the ground to collect and store rainwater, providing a larger storage capacity and a more discreet option for capturing and utilizing rainwater.</p></p>
